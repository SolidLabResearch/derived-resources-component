# Derived resources

Adds support for derived resources to a
[Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer) instance.

Run `npm start` to have a CSS instance that combines `@css:config/file.json` with the new components here.

## What are derived resources?

Derived resources are resources whose contents are determined by aggregating contents of other resources.
This allows you to apply different access control rules to resources that, for example,
reveal a subset of certain data.

## How does it work

Derived resources, as implemented in this repository,
consist of 3 components:
- The template, describing the URL through which the derived resource is accessible.
- One or more selectors, that determine the resources that are an input for the derivation.
- The filter, which is applied to the selector to determine the result.

To create a derived resource, the above 3 components should be described in the metadata of a container.
For example:
```turtle
@prefix derived: <urn:npm:solid:derived-resources:> .

<http://localhost:3000/> derived:derivedResource [
    derived:template "test";
    derived:selector <http://localhost:3000/selector>;
    derived:filter <http://localhost:3000/filter>
  ].
```
If the above is in the metadata of container `http://localhost:3000/`,
the resource `http://localhost:3000/test`.
As input, the resource found at `http://localhost:3000/selector` will be used,
and the output will be generated by the query found at `http://localhost:3000/filter`.

The last modified date, and the resulting ETag, of the derived resource
is that of the most recently changed selector.

Below are some more details on each of the fields.

### Template

This string will be concatenated to the URL of the container to determine the URL of the derived resource.
URL templates such as `"{testVar}"` can be used, and their value will be fed into the filter.
When such a URL template is used, all URLs that match will be accessible,
so with this value you would be able to access `http://localhost:3000/foo`,
`http://localhost:3000/bar`, etc.

It is also possible to define derived resources by editing the metadata of a document instead of a container.
In that case the template value should be the empty string.
The actual body of such a document is irrelevant and can be anything.

### Selectors

The data of all resources linked here will be combined before executing the filter in the next step.

Instead of a fixed URL, these can also contain a Wildcard
to select all elements in a container in the form of a `/*`.
For example, if the object in the selector triple was `"http://localhost:3000/*"`,
all documents found in the `http://localhost:3000/` container will be used.

### Filter

This should be the identifier of a resource that contains a valid SPARQL query.

In case the template contained a URL template, the resulting value(s) can be used here.
This is done with a simple string replacement on the query.
To continue the example of before,
all occurrences of `$testVar$` in the SPARQL query will be replaced with the provided value.

## Examples

When starting the server with `npm run start:example`,
it will generate several sample resources to set up several derived resources.
Have a look at the `templates/root/base` folder for the full data.
The metadata of the root container defines 3 different derived resources:
- `http://localhost:3000/test`: A basic derived resource applying a query to a single selector.
- `http://localhost:3000/template/{var}`: A template for derived resources where `var` will be applied to the query.
     You can try out http://localhost:3000/template/foaf:knows and http://localhost:3000/template/foaf:name.
- `http://localhost:3000/pattern`: A derived resource whose selectors are all resources in a container.

The first derived resource can also be found at `http://localhost:3000/dummy.txt`,
as that resource has its own metadata defining it to be a derived resource.

## TODOs

- Write tests for everything.

## Known limitations/decisions

- No locks are used when reading data from the selectors. This to prevent potential deadlocks.
- There is no caching, so derived resources are generated from scratch on every request.
- Authorization on the selector resources is ignored.
  Note that this allows users to access data they do not have access to if they guess the URL of such data.
  We might want to implement it so creating a derived resource requires read access on all selectors,
  similar to notifications.
  This could be done by adding a new `PermissionReader` that checks the contents of a PATCH for such triples.
- An extra conversion store is added to the config as the new `ResourceStore` needs to do content negotiation
  on data it receives from the backend,
  but also wants to allow content negotiation on the data stream it generates.
- The metadata describing these resources is readable for anyone who can read the associated resource.
  If necessary, the solution could be changed to remove that metadata on GET requests.
- The filter triple could be extended to also allow the value directly in the object instead of being in a separate resource.
- The filter could be extended to also support external URIs.
